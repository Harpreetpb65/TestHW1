    Introduction

My portfolio web page is a fusion of my academic journey and personal interests. It highlights the synergy between
my computer science studies at UC-Davis and my extracurricular passions, offering
a glimpse into my world beyond the binary.

Design Choices:

Content stands out without interference through minimalistic design, having a 
peaceful cream color pattern. The decision to use Roboto family as the website’s
font was purposefully intended to make it look both stylish and readable. Visual 
elements such as sunrise and sunset portray the beginning and end of activities 
undertaken daily in line with learning process which never ends.

Responsive Design Techniques:

Fluidity and adaptability are terms that describe how this website appears on 
different devices, thanks to CSS media queries whose work is to ensure that 
regardless of where it is viewed from the display will be seamless. Both images 
and texts assume proportions dynamically so as for one to get rid of spacing 
problems while maintaining aesthetics hence creating an enjoyable user experience 
irrespective of device size.Also adding a "top Arrow" button at the bottom to 
quickly navigate to the top of the page.

Accessibility Considerations:

In order for all people to have equal access rights to technology, 
semantic HTML5 was used in structuring content along with alt attributes 
accompanying every image, leading us into this path. With focus on keyboard 
navigability, no matter how disabled someone is, he or she can navigate through 
the entire site effectively.

Personal Significance and Challenges:

My philosophy regarding simplifying complicated issues has been demonstrated by 
this project since I harmonized education with technology. In particular, 
responsive design was challenging due to image scaling; thus indicating this was 
more about determining my CSS skills than anything else. This achievement together 
with other challenges has increased not only my technical talents but also 
re-affirmed my commitment towards digital solutions that simplify customer 
experiences.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am Harpreet Basota, a fourth-year Computer Science student.
        I am currently doing my undergrad at the University of California-Davis. I have a passion towards
        developing innovative apps coupled with an eye for accuracy as a sports enthusiast.I merge
        coding knowledge and techniques into strategic plays on the cricket and football
        pitches. Aspiring to be a tech visionary, my educational path is a living proof of how technology
        can recreate our everyday activities. I aim to create digital footprints that smoothen user
        experiences by making them simple and faster</p>

    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond code, I get equilibrium from sports besides programing for instance
        the meticulousness of playing badminton, soccer's group harmony 
        or intricacy in cricket are my hobbies that sharpen my concentration and ignite zest for life.
        I also love reading so much and likes to always find new books to gain more knowledge and
        broaden ones thinking.
